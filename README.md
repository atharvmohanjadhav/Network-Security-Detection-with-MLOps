# üö¶ Network Security Detection with MLOps

This project implements an end-to-end **Network Security Detection System** powered by **Machine Learning** and integrated with modern **MLOps practices**. The pipeline covers the full ML lifecycle ‚Äî from data ingestion to deployment, monitoring, and CI/CD automation.

## üß† Overview

The project follows a modular and scalable MLOps architecture with the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Source: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based)
   - Raw data is ingested and stored locally for further processing.

2. **Data Validation & Transformation**:  
   - Schema validation, missing value treatment, data cleaning.
   - Feature engineering and transformation for model compatibility.

3. **Model Training & Selection**:  
   - Multiple ML models are trained and evaluated.
   - Best model is selected based on performance metrics.
   - Model tracking and versioning are done using **MLflow**.

4. **Experiment Tracking**:  
   - Remote tracking using **DagsHub** to monitor logs, metrics, and artifacts.

5. **Batch Prediction**:  
   - A **FastAPI** endpoint is created to perform batch predictions on new incoming data.

6. **Containerization & Deployment**:  
   - Docker image is created for the entire application.
   - Image is stored in **AWS S3** and deployed on **AWS EC2** instance.

7. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
   - Automated using **GitHub Actions**.
   - Deployment pipeline pushes latest changes to AWS EC2 for production deployment.

## üì¶ Deployment Instructions

- Dockerize the application:
  ```bash
  docker build -t network-security-detection-app .
  ```

- Push image to AWS S3 and deploy on EC2 instance.

- CI/CD is handled via GitHub Actions. On every push to the main branch, the pipeline:
